Guide to new model
------------------------------
1. Copy this branch to a new branch and rename it accordningly. 

2. Setup your database connections in appsettings.json in projects AppSeeder and DbContext

3. Setup your models in project Models,
  - add your own models and make sure the namespace is Models.

4. Set you primary Keys in the models
  - make sure each model has a primary Key of type GUID, notes as [Key]
    For example
      [Key]
      public Guid FriendId {get; set;}

  - make sure Navigation properties are setup to capture one-to-one, one-to-many,
    many-to-one, or many-to-many in ALL related classes
    
    For example below to set many-to-one between tables between Friends and Addresses
    In Friends table
      public Address Address { get; set; } = null;
    In Address table
      public List<Friend> Residents{ get; set; } = null;

  - recompile should be OK

5. Setup EFC to use your new models. In project DbContext class MainDbContext.cs
    For example
    public DbSet<Friend> Friends { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Address> Addresses { get; set; }

   - replace existing All DbSet<> models with you new models. 

6. Remove any old model in project Models
   - recompile should now indicate errors in program.cs. This is ok

7. Modify AppSeeder to use your new models

In project AppSeeder update bewlo methods to reflect your own model
    - WriteModel()
    - SeedModel()
    - SeedingDatabase() 
    - QueryDatabaseAsync() 

- recompile should be OK

8. Create your database

In folder .scripts open a terminal and type
./database-rebuild-all.sh

- You should be able to see a created database and tables with Azure Data Studio


9. Create and Populate your database

In folder .scripts open a terminal and type
./database-rebuild-all.sh seed
